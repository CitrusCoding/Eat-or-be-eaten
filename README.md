# Eat-or-be-eaten
(JS 11 Final Project)
A little fish game created using Javascript/HTML

Honestly I don't remember how this code works, I made it like 3 years ago

You play as a little fish, use the arrow keys to swim around and eat food (green algee for one point, goldfish for 5)
avoid touching the sharks or they will eat you

note: the hitbox on the sharks is too big - this is because the shark image is rectangular, the edges are just transparent
hit the button in the top right corner to respawn - this only works while you are actively playing the game unfortunately 
(you have to refresh the page after dying if you want to replay)

the higher the difficulty, the more sharks spawn - easy mode adds more food as well

all art done by me :^)
